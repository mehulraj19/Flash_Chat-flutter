# Flash_Chat-flutter
This is a chat Application that will be powered with Firebase database. Right Now, I have worked on using Animations on Applications and how we can use both custom animations as
well as packages from flutter.

Today, I have completed the App work here. I have connected the App with Firebase database: firestore. I have used time-stamp to order the chats and worked more on having better
UI for the user.
